async and await are two keywords that can help make asynchronous code read more like synchronous code. This can help code look cleaner while keeping the benefits of asynchronous code.


Purpose of async and await:

1 - Non-blocking Execution:
Prevents the main thread from being blocked while waiting for long-running operations (e.g., database calls, API requests, file I/O).
Keeps the UI responsive in desktop and web applications.

2 - Improves Performance & Scalability:
Frees up threads to handle other requests while waiting for a task to complete.
Essential for web applications handling multiple requests simultaneously.

3 - Better Code Readability:
Makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code, avoiding callbacks and improving maintainability.
