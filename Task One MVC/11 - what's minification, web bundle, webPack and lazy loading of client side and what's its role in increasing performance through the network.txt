Minification
Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters (like whitespace, comments, and line breaks) from code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) without changing its functionality.

Role in Performance:
Reduces file size, leading to faster downloads over the network.
Improves page load time, especially on slow connections.

Web Bundles
Web Bundles are a collection of resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) packaged into a single file for efficient delivery over the network.

Role in Performance:
Reduces HTTP requests, which decreases latency and improves load time.
Optimizes caching since the browser only needs to cache one file instead of multiple files.

WebPack
WebPack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies (like JavaScript, CSS, images) and generates static assets (bundles).

Role in Performance:
Reduces file size through minification and compression.
Improves load time by splitting code and loading only whatâ€™s needed.
Enhances caching by generating unique filenames for bundles.

Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is a technique where resources (like images, JavaScript, or components) are loaded only when they are needed, rather than all at once.

Role in Performance:
Reduces initial page load time by loading only essential resources.
Saves bandwidth by loading resources on demand.
Improves user experience by making the page interactive faster.
