The main reason we use IActionResult instead of ActionResult is because IActionResult is an interface that provides more flexibility and better handles different types of return values.

For example, you can return:
View() for rendering a view.
Json() for returning JSON data.
Redirect() for redirecting to another action or URL.
This flexibility is not possible with ActionResult

Ex:
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
{
    var product = _productService.GetProductById(id);
    
    if (product == null)
    {
        return NotFound(new { message = "Product not found" }); // Returns 404
    }

    if (!product.IsActive)
    {
        return BadRequest(new { message = "Product is inactive" }); // Returns 400
    }

    return Ok(product); // Returns 200 with product data
}


Problems with Using ActionResult
Limited Flexibility: You cannot return multiple types of results from the same method.
Harder to Test: ActionResult is a concrete class, making it harder to mock and test.
Less Future-Proof: If new result types are introduced, you may need to refactor your code
