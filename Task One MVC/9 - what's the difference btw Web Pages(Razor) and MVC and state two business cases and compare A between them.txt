What is Web Pages (Razor)?
Razor Pages is a page-based web development framework.
Uses .cshtml files where both HTML and C# code are combined.
Each page has a corresponding C# code-behind file (.cshtml.cs).
Best for simple, lightweight applications that donâ€™t require complex routing.
EX:
@model IndexModel
<h1>Welcome, @Model.Username!</h1>

Case: 	A basic product showcase without login/cart features.



What is MVC (Model-View-Controller)?
MVC follows a structured pattern separating Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic).
Used for complex, enterprise-level applications.
Provides better organization and maintainability.
EX:
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        ViewData["Message"] = "Welcome!";
        return View();
    }
}

Case: A full e-commerce platform with login, cart, and payment system.
